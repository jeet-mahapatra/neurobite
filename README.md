🔧 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
404 on Page Refresh: If you encounter 404 errors on page refresh, ensure your hosting platform is configured to redirect all routes to index.html for client-side routing
Authentication Errors: Check that your JWT token is properly stored and not expiring prematurely
API Connection Issues: Verify the API URL and ensure CORS is properly configured
